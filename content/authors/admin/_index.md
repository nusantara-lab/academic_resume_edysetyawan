# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I have a strong interest in wildlife research focusing on the population dynamics and spatial movement ecology of elasmobranch. While my main focus has been on manta rays and whale sharks, I am also keen on conducting research on other elasmobranch species, such as thresher sharks, walking sharks, and zebra sharks. My research involves the use of photographic identification (photo ID), passive acoustic telemetry, satellite telemetry, drones, and remote sensing to examine the population dynamics and spatial movement ecology of manta ray populations in Indonesia (mainly in Raja Ampat – Bird’s Head Seascape) and New Zealand.
